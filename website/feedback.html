						<h2>Dat</h2> 
						<p><br><br>
							Trung: Trung is an amazing team member. He is the most experienced member of the group regarding the website development area. With that ability, he often volunteered to do those most difficult tasks about coding. After solving the problem with his working style from the last assignment, in this assignment, he started working in every progress of the group - not starting his work lately like the previous assignment. His communication skill also improved so much, and that leads to the atmosphere of the group being so friendly. In the end, I have no complaints about this amazing teammate. <br>
							Anh: Quang Anh is an amazing team member. In this assignment, after knowing his weakness in communication skills, he actively discussed more with us about his idea. He also proactively chose the part that fit him the most in the assignment to utilize his ability. He is also willing to explore more tools and technology that he is not familiar with to help the product of our team become much better. However, I still feel there are some barriers that still exist between us. Overall, I have no complaints about this amazing teammate about the group work, but I hope he can be more open to sharing with us about personal things.<br>
							Dat (myself): I consider myself to be a good member. After knowing my weakness from the previous assignment, I created my own plan and acted as a compass to not get lost or distracted. As a result, I can overcome it and start working early every week, not like how I worked in the previous assignment. I also tried my best and volunteered in some parts that I knew that I was good at or I knew I can learn in the given amount of time. I am the most “naive” one in the team, so I will not try to hold everybody back. I put so much effort to do my part to achieve excellent quality. After finishing my work, if there is time, I would glance at other works and offer a hand if they need it. I knew that I still have my own weakness, but thanks to my team, they helped me to become much better. In the end, I glad to have a change <br>
							Minh: Minh is an amazing team member. He is the one who created a base for us from the last assignment. In this assignment, his working enthusiast still is the same as the previous assignment. However, he still worked his best to improve his enthusiasm to communicate with every one of our team. All in all, he evolves at an incredible speed. As one of his teammates, I am really glad that he can relax in our group environment and have more energy to work with us in this assignment. Generally, I have no complaints about this amazing teammate.<br><br>
							</p>
							<h2>Trung</h2> <br><br>
							<p>Trung (Myself): I consider myself as a good member. I volunteered to do most of the work in the prototype of our team’s project idea. However, without the ideas contributed by others, I cannot achieve an excellent outcome in the end. After realizing the problem from the previous assignment, I had planned carefully and started working right after the end of the previous assignment. I also made more conversation in the group. I believe that is one of the elements to create a friendly and welcome atmosphere for other members to share their thoughts. In this assignment, I have tried to strengthen my strengths and improve my weaknesses. In conclusion, I believe I had contributed all of my ability to work in this assignment, and most importantly, I learned so many things thanks to my teammates.
								<br><br>Dat: He's a good member. In this assignment, he still retained his desire to achieve ambitious goals. He contributed many significant ideas that required the ability to look at every detail in our product. He also actively responds to group chat and group discussion. I believe that he changed after knowing his own problem with communication can negatively affect the group. He also started working more methodically, starting early, and doing each part following the deadlines according to the team’s plan. Generally, I have no complaints towards him and I feel really glad to have a chance to work with him.
								<br><br>Minh: He's also a good member. At the beginning of the assignment, he actively shared his thoughts about what things we should focus on first, which is quite different from the last assignment. I believe that he knew communication is key for our group to work more effectively and with teamwork, we can achieve a more ambitious goal, which cannot be done by an individual. He showed more enthusiasm for working as a team. I believe that is the most obvious evidence that he is trying to be a part of a group. In the end, he is a really good member that I would like to collaborate with again and until now, I have no complaints towards him.
								<br><br>Anh: He's definitely a good member. In the previous assignment, he did not actively work in every group activity, however, things have changed since then. In this assignment, he becomes more active to take responsibility for his part, which makes me feel quite surprised. I believe at first he is so quiet in the group simply because of his characteristics, but after knowing more about each other, he is more open to everyone. Therefore, group progress is becoming more smooth and achieving excellent outcomes. In the end, I have no complaints towards him after watching his process of evolving.

								<h2>Minh</h2>
						<p>Minh (myself)<br>
							Overall, as I advanced to Assignment 3, I have had enough experiences to work in this current group as well as how to complete Assignment 3, which is similar to the last 2 assignments. I personally felt that my communication skills improved and my productivity during the whole assignment was better than that of the last 2. I can also feel that my writing skill and management skills were greatly benefitted by doing this assignment. While my workflow has improved significantly, the impact on the real project was small. One reason was that I did not have the knowledge and capability to create/maintain a website. My most noticeable problem in this assignment was that I lacked the enthusiasm to actively contribute to the real project. This issue must be solved by myself and could only be solved by myself.<br><br>
							
							Dat<br>
							Dat has been a wonderful team member since assignment 2, it only got better through time. He was responsible for the overall management of our team, which was great compared to the other teams I had experienced with. His writing has always been polished and resulted in fantastic outcomes. He was sociable and responded well during debates. He was willing to express his ideas and defend them when he thought they were right. If I were to nitpick bad behavior out of him, that would be his habit of staying up late at night and waking up late. This sometimes made conversations disconnected. <br><br>
							
							Trung<br>
							Trung was the most important member during assignment 3. Firstly, about his team-working skills, They were on the same level as that during assignment 2, which were great. He responded constructively and timely on important aspects. He also joined in small conversations, which were crucial for team bonding as we got to know each other more. About the real project, he was the lead developer for the team as he was the only one has enough knowledge to build a website from scratch. So he worked diligently and delivered a good final product which would have been impossible without him. His drawback is that he did not participate much in the reporting process, thus made the team difficult to understand what he was doing.<br><br>
							Anh was a great team member during assignment 3. While he did not talk much during conversations but he shared his ideas and became more friendly. He took responsibility in his work and delivered his parts timely with effort shown in the quality of his work. His drawback was that he did not share his thoughts easily, thus making debates and normal conversations took longer to get in a comfortable atmosphere (or he just had nothing to say, which was totally acceptable). But sometimes his silence was a good thing as it calmed the debate down and gave people time to reflect on ideas.<br><br>
							</p>
							<h2>Anh</h2><br><br>
							<p>Dat:<br>
								He is a great member, he realized his weakness very quickly and managed to create his own plan and stick to it so he can focus more on the project than he ever needed to be compared to the last assignment. As the result of him being very detail oriented and working with the project very early. He’s even willing to devote his time to be very responsive in the group discussion, coming up with new plans and ideas on how we all should tackle the situation. And he is super helpful, not only that he usually offer a helping hand to pretty much everyone almost weekly he also manage to push everyone to do their best for the project, I really glad I have him as one my teammate for the project and I really have no complains towards him beside wanting to tell him that he should lay back a bit more, he really deserved it.<br><br>
							   
							   
							   Trung:<br>
								I find that he is a very good team member, he is willing to do the prototype for the whole group single handedly since he is the most experienced in this field compared to the whole group. And with that experience, he often takes on more difficult tasks in developing the website and responsible for one of the bigger tasks in the whole group as well. I have noticed that he has also planned out more carefully compared to the last group work that we had, he spent more time working with almost everything within the group whether it is content research or finding, writing and even some designing. His communication skill has improved a lot that leads to a very open atmosphere and also being very friendly. Generally, I have no complaints about him.<br><br>
							   
							   
							   Minh:<br>
								I consider him a great teammate, he is the one who created a base for us to work on in the last assignment and contributed a lot in this one as well as his enthusiasm. He generally shares his thoughts a lot about what should be considered first and what is more important and efficient for everyone. We all know that no one could achieve a big goal all by themselves and which he stepped in and helped guide everyone to their desired yet common goal. In the end, I am very thankful for his work and would love to be able to collaborate with him again sometime in the future.<br><br>
							   
							   
							   Anh(myself): <br>
							   I would still not consider that I am a good member, it is true that I did try to communicate more in the group discussion and try to fit in by giving some of my thoughts. Although I try to make my content as refined as possible however the contents that I have to manage is still considerably shorter than everyone else, yet I would still manage to be the last one to complete. Because the environment that the whole group manages to build up, it made me feel too relaxed and do everything at my own pace rather than be super on time like the rest of the team. Even though I usually find the team’s decision is already very good and I don’t have much to say but the important part in building a good working environment is still to give out your thoughts and potential backup plan for everything which is what I extremely lack.</p>
