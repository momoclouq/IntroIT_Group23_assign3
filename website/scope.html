						<h2>Scope and Limits</h2> <br><br>
						<p>The first feature of our website is helping our users to find the appropriate recipes for specific leftovers. We have a wide range of choices and recipes for the typical leftovers of Vietnamese people. We also try to include some recipes related to famous Western fast foods because most young Vietnamese people these days tend to prefer eating those foods. This feature's limitation is that it does not have any recipes for fusion foods, and most of the recipes come from our own experience and creativity, and little part from another source. Therefore, we do not know our users will have the same taste as we have.<br><br>

							Our website's second feature is helping our users calculate the total calories of the dishes that are cooked following our recipes on our page and some common dishes in Vietnam. The limitation of this feature is that we do not have an accurate number for each dish. We only show the average number. This is because, in a different part of our country or the other restaurant, they have a "unique" style of seasoning, so we do not have an exact figure for each dish of a particular region or restaurant.<br><br>
							
							Another feature of our website is providing our users with educational and informative articles or news associated with foods and health. However, at the moment, we can not publish our articles. We can only provide our users those articles from another source. We will translate those articles into Vietnamese and add a few of our opinions and advice in the context of Vietnam.<br><br>
							
							The remaining features are Support and Log in/ Sign up. In the Support page, we created a place to provide our users the answers to some basic and common questions regarding our product. If there is no answer to their question, there is a section that they can type their concern directly and send it to us to get the fastest response. This feature's limitation is that we want to include one more part to everyone interested in our product and want to collaborate or invest in us. However, this seems like it needs a bit more professional design.<br><br>
							
							Regarding the Login/ Sign up feature, we allow users to create a new account or log in via Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Nevertheless, this is just a sample because most of the team members do not have any experience in dealing with the back-end part in web programming. Thus, we are not able to create a database in three weeks.<br><br>

							<h2>Testing</h2> <br><br>
							<p>The overall site functioned properly, everything was pretty much in order for how short it took for us to build the site. After some rough testing, I have noticed there were some inconsistencies in the font due to the use of the Vietnamese language, despite that, everything was clear enough and informative enough to be usable for a home page. And with everything set up, What I found is also in the content in the menu, I agreed that everything is built nicely and functional, dishes are correctly placed in their rightful orders with ID codes for the later use of the Calories calculation although there is some misalignment to the dishes image and especially the dish “Fried noodle with egg and sausages” were out of the frame and the learn more button is reduced to half-sized which can create trouble for some people and there is a bug in the drinks section that is bugged, they lead to the first recipe on pretty much all of them. However there are some issues with the recipes which they are very roughly mentioned, in 4-5 dishes that have been checked pretty much none of them suggest a specific volume of oil, water, or sauce in the process of making the dish, I agreed that yes this is a reference menu for leftovers which means that not everyone will have that exact amount laying around to make the dish, but I would say that oil and water or even some sauces that are very important in making a dish, I am fully aware that this is just nitpicking however there are people who have a lot of trouble handling an unknown about of ingredient that they have to manage. Moving on to another function that is the calorie calculation, this function worked pretty much as planned although not very accurate which is fine since we don't have any backend to store a lot of data and sort them through but there is this unnecessarily clickable total calories value that leads to nowhere which is a bug that should be addressed since some people might unknowingly click and leads to confusions. On the News section, there are a lot of inconsistencies throughout the page, the picture shows one thing and the content reveals another and also all of them possess the same content. However the following pages are very well done, they are very informative about why i should use the page and what i can benefit from it alongside answering some general questions that I do have with the content of the site, they have also given enough contact information for some further questions or trouble which is a good plus.

							<h2>Risks</h2> <br><br>
							<p>There are different combinations of food that is usually eaten together would make a better meal, however, there is also common combination of foods that have calcium and oxalic acid like chocolate milk, when the two additives combined and form insoluble calcium oxalate, which is not only indigestible but also can cause diarrhea. Another example is bean curd and spinach, when these ingredients are eaten together, they affect the absorption of calcium and may lead to blockages in the abdomen which is very serious. This effect happens due to the fact that Spinach contains oxalic acid, which can react with the calcium in bean curd in the intestines and form insoluble precipitates of calcium oxalate. There are also articles about eating bean curd mixed with green onions over a long time, it can lead to a lack of calcium causing spasms, osteomalacia, and fractures. Which is the risk that we have to face when we are building up the site, whether it is safe to combine these foods together or should the user eat this dish and another along with it or not?
								<br><br>Another risk that we have to take into account is food poisoning — also called foodborne illness — is caused by harmful germs, such as bacteria in contaminated food. In Vietnam, to practice food safety, people usually quickly refrigerate perishable foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs, etc. The goal is to reduce the time a food is in the "danger zone" — between 40 and 140 F (4 and 60 C) — which is the time where bacteria can quickly multiply. Bacteria typically don't change the taste, smell, or look of the food, you can't tell whether a food is dangerous to eat. Many have said to put those items in a continuous heating source like a slow cooker. However, experts don't recommend slow cookers for reheating leftovers as these devices may not heat foods hot enough to kill bacteria. Fortunately, most cases of food poisoning can be prevented with proper cooking and food handling which is what we aim to provide for every user who is into the site. Not only helping everyone to preserve food but able to reuse and potentially send them to people in need.<br><br>
								Another problem that came up in mind for us, that is when we publish the site into the public, how would people be able to access the site, what hosting service will we be using, how is the site going to profit from the user to be able to maintain itself? How we as a small team be able to host our product and service on a website is a big problem, we will have to figure out how to monetize the site and we still want to keep the site access-able for everyone which generate two decisions whether we should take the freemium approach or ad-based. In one hand, it means that we are going to get more money to keep the site running, however, this is scare of other customers as well since if we take that approach there will be some limited recipe that's going to be more common for people to find ingredients or dishes around to use and sometime people would just use the free recipe and not bother about paying at all which is another problem. On the other hand, which is ad-based, that give us a small amount every time an ad plays, that can help us get a small amount of financial support, which is ok and give us a consistent income to maintain the server, however people usually use ad-block nowadays and there are people who will get super skeptical when they see an ad and sometimes just leave which is a very major problem that we will have to face. <br><br>
								This leads to how can we keep the site safe from attackers and also financial problems on maintaining a website for a long time.

							<h2>Group processes and communications</h2> <br><br>
							<p>The means of communication are:<br><br>
								Facebook messenger (text): Most of our communications are on Facebook messenger as all of the team members have a Facebook account and use messenger frequently. This also means that we are used to the interface of this texting application, thus avoiding the need of getting used to a different messaging applications (Whatsapp, viber, zalo, etc). These messages are mostly used for normal conversations, discussions of small details and voting.<br>
								 Frequency: almost daily<br><br>
								Group meeting (face to face, on RMIT campus): We have decided that we would hold a group meeting every Thursday, when we would discuss in detail the things that we need to do and the problems that require group work. The specific time is flexible and chosen during the messages in Facebook messenger. Normally, everyone in the team has to show up on time and participate in the group discussion, this is until now the truth about my team.<br>
								 Frequency: Once a week on Thursday, can have more if needed.<br><br>
								Github commit messages and readme file: This method is to show the exact detail of the work that has been done by members. The whole team can follow the commit messages and continue working without negatively affecting the project. Readme file is used as a workflow description and a place for important notes for the whole team.<br>
								 Frequency: Once or twice a week, more when it is closer to the deadline.<br><br>
								Google Spreadsheet: This method is to show the accurate work distribution among the members and the progress of their respective work in detail (the members can describe their own progress without the bothersome layout of GitHub or the need to rely on abstract comments of git commits). This method is particularly effective in monitoring the timeframe and the progress of each member.<br>
								 Frequency: Once a day for each member (or at least when he/she finishes his work in that day)<br><br>
								Email: This method is used for information exchange when the data is important and required to be typed in a formal format. An example would be the details of user experience design of the web page, sent from the UX designer to the developer.<br>
								 Frequency: Depend on individuals<br><br>
								 There are other forms of communication such as talking during the lectures, tutorials or individual meetings/messages, but these are insignificant and impossible to record/ keep track of.
