						<h2>Minh</h2> <br><br>
						<p>As the group has reached assignment 3, every member in the group was comfortable in the group's conversation. Team-working sessions were nice and gave out a friendly, relaxing feeling. The tasks were well divided among the members according to their preferences and strengths. The overall progress of the project was manageable and logically suitable for the timeline. I can see that every member has put in much effort to finish the final product/report. There were some areas in communications and management that could be improved but they were minor and insignificant. One surprising aspect of team working during this assignment was that we were not required to communicate much to divide the task and still managed to work more productively than during the assignment 2. I believed that this was because our bond as a team was stronger than that during assignment 2. I personally learned to work more effectively in a team and how to properly manage a group’s timeline. I could say the more we work as a group towards a common goal, the more necessary for us to communicate and overcome the problems together. The reason is that the final product is impossible for one member to do by himself.
						</p>
						<br><br><h2>Anh</h2> <br><br>
						<p>After we are done with assignment 2, every member setted a plan for assignment 3, everyone is satisfied with the flow and comfortable in the conversations throughout the first week of planning and everything starts from there. Started off by having a more proper discussion and plans for each and every member, so they could start on doing their part immediately and try to work around some problems that we had in the second assignment. Compared to the second assignment, this project work gave me a more relaxed and enjoying time throughout the whole time working on it, since we had discussion almost everyday, report on almost everything that everyone have done at the end of the day whether it through Facebook message or Google spreadsheet, in which they don’t make me constantly coming up with a backup everytime I think about the project compare to the first two weeks in assignment 2. Every member has put a lot of effort in making the product this time around not like the last 2 weeks of constant commits like before. The surprising thing is that even though we communicated a lot but our downside is still within that region which is sharing more detailed thoughts and managing workflow within each and every member. However this is very minor, since we all have already divided our task for each member so it is clearer for everyone that who is doing what and managed to be more productive than assignment 2. From what I have seen from the team members, It is pretty clear that our team aimed to be more productive and content rich than before where we just kinda go with the flow and fill in whatever gap we could find which teached me that whatever I find or contribute, I should always aim for the quality more even if the given time is </p>
						<br><br><h2>Dat</h2> <br><br>
						<p>In my opinion, the things that went well in our group is everyone learned many valuable lessons from the previous assignment and tried their best to not make those previous mistakes again. In this assignment, we proactively set up the plan for each part and have a tool to keep track of every member’s progress. We had more meetings and discussions about the assignment, which is really nice since we had a chance to hear the point of view from everyone in the group and choose the best option among those. Since everyone in the team knows each other well from many meeting sessions, the atmosphere in every meeting or in the group chat is really open and relaxing. The things that could be improved are that we need to have a precise calculation about the time of each task needed to not fall behind our plan in the beginning. Another thing that could be improved is our ability to break our limits. Everyone put much effort into this assignment, however, I believe with our team’s ability, we can push ourselves further. Regarding one thing that was surprising is our team’s ability. I mean I knew about the strengths of each person when I was talking to them from the time the group is formed, but when we work together, I realized they have more skills than I thought. They are also more than willing to teach everyone in the group everything they knew in an enthusiastic way. One thing that I learned about group work is that each individual in the group is really important. Each person has very interesting ideas and we need to do something to create a “safe” environment for each one to share their thoughts. Overall, I am really satisfied with our team and our outcomes.
						</p>
						<br><br><h2>Trung</h2> <br><br>
						<p>From the previous assignment, I felt a little bit down in the beginning when I thought the team would be great but the result is the opposite. Until the end of it, I have more confidence to believe that my first thought is correct. As soon as we perceived the problem of our group, we started working on it immediately. We had more meetings, plans, and deadlines for small tasks. Everyone contributed a lot of amazing ideas and everyone in our team has the ability to keep their ego down and listen to others’ ideas and will make changes if that idea is better compared to the old one. One thing that our team can be improved is our time management skills and plan-making skill. We need to make our deadlines for each part that fits our strengths and ability. If we can do that, we can ensure that we cannot fall behind the plan. The thing that was surprising is that the team’s ambition and our willingness to achieve that ambitious goal. We have set a goal that is far more than the requirements, but we are able to manage it and achieve our goal. I believe this is the power of teamwork and each person’s desire to achieve the same goals. The most valuable lesson I learned through this assignment is that I must have a belief in my teammates to handle their individual parts. With the huge amount of work in this assignment, there is no time to check in detail how everyone is going on. Therefore, I have to believe in them. As a result, they have done their work incredibly excellent. That is when I realized that lesson and I will use all of my experience working with those amazing people to work with everyone in the future.

						<br><br><h2>Group Reflection</h2> <br><br>
						<p>As a group, the things that went well for us is that each member has an ability to keep their egos down to listen to others’ opinions. All members still retained a high sense of responsibility for their work. In this assignment, we had created a detailed plan for each part of the assignment. We learned many valuable lessons from the last assignment, so we decided to hold a meeting each week until there was no work that required a group decision. The plan and our tactic was really successful. The evidence for this is that we achieve the most ambitious goal in our, creating the finest prototype of our product in the given amount of time. We also divided specific roles for each member and created a tool to keep track with others' progress. With everything being planned carefully, the workflow of us became more smoothly, more effective and less stressful than the previous assignment, when we did not have a detailed plan to do our assignment.
							<br><br>
							Regarding the things that can be improved, we should aim for higher goals. We know that the prototype and the report have excellent results, thanks to all the team members. However, we really want to try to plan for a higher goal and see how far we can go in that path. Another thing that can be improved is that we can create a more detailed plan and make some changes in the plan due to the current stage in the week. We know that this might be time-consuming in some aspects, but with the changed plans for each stage, we can compare it to the original plan to see whether there are some things wrong that we need to fix. If we have that, each member will have more evidence to reflect back to the past and evolve more.
							<br><br>
							 The surprising thing is that the atmosphere of the group and the effectiveness of the group is increasing time by time. At first, after understanding our group problem, we thought we can only work effectively as teammates, however we now like brothers that can feel very relaxing when sharing our opinions. 
							 <br><br>
							 The most crucial lessons that we all learned from this experience is that each individual in the group is all very crucial. Each one also contributed to the group in their own ways. Even there are still some flaws, but we believe that it is unavoidable because each person has their own strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, we are really happy to have a chance to work together.
