# Workflow 

- 2 separated repo: report (writing the report) and project (doing the project)

- Looking for things to do? Check the excel link for work distribution (Project description spreedsheet)

- The group-required parts of the report will be done in the docs link below
- Small individual parts (individual profile, etc) should be typed directly to the draft
- The individual parts (project description) of the report will be done in individual folders (create your own in the report folder!)
