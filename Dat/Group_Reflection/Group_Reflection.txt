•	In my opinion, the things that went well in our group is everyone learned many valuable lessons from the previous assignment and tried their best to not make those previous mistakes again. In this assignment, we proactively set up the plan for each part and have a tool to keep track of every member’s progress. We had more meetings and discussions about the assignment, which is really nice since we had a chance to hear the point of view from everyone in the group and choose the best option among those. Since everyone in the team knows each other well from many meeting sessions, the atmosphere in every meeting or in the group chat is really open and relaxing. The things that could be improved are that we need to have a precise calculation about the time of each task needed to not fall behind our plan in the beginning. Another thing that could be improved is our ability to break our limits. Everyone put much effort into this assignment, however, I believe with our team’s ability, we can push ourselves further. Regarding one thing that was surprising is our team’s ability. I mean I knew about the strengths of each person when I was talking to them from the time the group is formed, but when we work together, I realized they have more skills than I thought. They are also more than willing to teach everyone in the group everything they knew in an enthusiastic way. One thing that I learned about group work is that each individual in the group is really important. Each person has very interesting ideas and we need to do something to create a “safe” environment for each one to share their thoughts. Overall, I am really satisfied with our team and our outcomes.
