The collaboration of our group in Assignment 2 is quite good. Although there were some problems at the beginning when our communication skill was the main problem, we could come through and finished Assignment 2 with a good result. In Assignment 3, we decided to make some changes to the Group Process. We believed each person in the group should have a specific role in the Group Assignment. It will help each of our concentrates in a particular area and thrive to achieve phenomenal outcomes. Besides, that is the way of how we will work in the future in the company after graduating. Therefore, I believe this change will help us have a good result of this assignment and have the right mindset in the workplace environment in the future. Secondly, we will divide the whole big project into small tasks, and we will have small deadlines for each of those. This change is like a compass, which can help the Lead Developer keep track of each member's. This can also allow us to do our tasks early to have a better result rather than start working so late, and the product is awful.
