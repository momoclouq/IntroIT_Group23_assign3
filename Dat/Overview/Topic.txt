In our project, we want to create a website that contains a wide range of cooking recipes for left-overs and remaining ingredients after cooking to help our users to save their budget and alleviate the food-waste problem, which can help to make the environment becomes better by decreasing the greenhouse gases emitted during the process of dealing with the wasted foods or ingredients. We also want to help users avoid food poisoning by assisting users to safely consume “new” dishes with old ingredients or a mixture of ingredients of our recipes on our website.
We also want to help the user to have an active and balanced life. Therefore, we want to have a tool to calculate the total calories of some common dishes to let the users know the sum of calories they consume in one day or search for the calories of dishes they are about to eat. From there, we can support our users by suggesting the appropriate diet programs or menus for them. Besides, at the end of each recipe, we will also try to contain the calories of that dish and give our recommendations to different types of users to help them decide whether it is appropriate for them to eat cook and eat that dish according to their types of people or their diet program.
