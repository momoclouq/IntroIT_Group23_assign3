Honestly, it will be a liar if we say that our product is unique and be a pioneer in the market. There are plenty of products or systems out there with the same idea as our product, providing leftovers recipes. Some examples of those are BBCGoodFood and AllRecipes. However, we notice that they only included it as a small part of their product/system; and they only publish mostly Western cuisines and some few famous cuisines from the East. Therefore, we decided to focus on the Vietnam market, creating for Vietnamese. We will create a product with the content being written in Vietnamese and mainly focus on Vietnamese cuisines and some fusion dishes to serve Vietnamese people. Another point worth mentioning is that we want to help our users know what is going on with food waste problems these days. With our product, we can make their life more convenient and help them save money, and give them educative information to raise their awareness.
