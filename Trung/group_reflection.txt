•	From the previous assignment, I felt a little bit down in the beginning when I thought the team would be great but the result is the opposite. Until the end of it, I have more confidence to believe that my first thought is correct. As soon as we perceived the problem of our group, we started working on it immediately. We had more meetings, plans, and deadlines for small tasks. Everyone contributed a lot of amazing ideas and everyone in our team has the ability to keep their ego down and listen to others’ ideas and will make changes if that idea is better compared to the old one. One thing that our team can be improved is our time management skills and plan-making skill. We need to make our deadlines for each part that fits our strengths and ability. If we can do that, we can ensure that we cannot fall behind the plan. The thing that was surprising is that the team’s ambition and our willingness to achieve that ambitious goal. We have set a goal that is far more than the requirements, but we are able to manage it and achieve our goal. I believe this is the power of teamwork and each person’s desire to achieve the same goals. The most valuable lesson I learned through this assignment is that I must have a belief in my teammates to handle their individual parts. With the huge amount of work in this assignment, there is no time to check in detail how everyone is going on. Therefore, I have to believe in them. As a result, they have done their work incredibly excellent. That is when I realized that lesson and I will use all of my experience working with those amazing people to work with everyone in the future.
