There are different combinations of food that is usually eaten together would make a better meal, however there are also common combination of foods that have calcium and oxalic acid like chocolate milk, when the two additives combined and form insoluble calcium oxalate, which is not only indigestible but also can cause diarrhea. Another example is bean curd and spinach, when these ingredients are eaten together, they affect absorption of calcium and may lead to blockages in the abdomen which is very serious. This effect happens is due to the fact that Spinach contains oxalic acid, which can react with the calcium in bean curd in the intestines and form insoluble precipitates of calcium oxalate. There are also article about eating bean curd mixed with green onions over a long time, it can lead to a lack of calcium causing spasms, osteomalacia and fractures. Which is the risk that we have to face when we building up the site, whether it is safe to combine these foods together or should the user eat this dish and another along it or not.
Another risk that we have to take to account that is food poisoning — also called foodborne illness — is caused by harmful germs, such as bacteria in contaminated food. In Vietnam, to practice food safety, people usually quickly refrigerate perishable foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy and eggs, etc. The goal is to reduce the time a food is in the "danger zone" — between 40 and 140 F (4 and 60 C) — which is the time where bacteria can quickly multiply. Bacteria typically don't change the taste, smell or look of food, you can't tell whether a food is dangerous to eat. Many have said to put those item in a continuous heating source like a slow cooker. However, experts don't recommend slow cookers for reheating leftovers as these devices may not heat foods hot enough to kill bacteria.
Fortunately, most cases of food poisoning can be prevented with proper cooking and food handling which is what we aim to provide for every user who are into the site. Not only helping everyone on preserving food but able to reuse and potentially send them to people in need.
