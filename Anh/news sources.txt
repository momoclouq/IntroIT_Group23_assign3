In other words, if bacteria or yeasts are going to encounter your food at some point in the digestive process, it most certainly won't be in your stomach – no matter how many hours that food sits there waiting to empty after a large, mixed meal.
The stomach's main purpose is blending food so there's maximum surface area exposed to the multiple digestive enzymes it will encounter in the small intestine – where the vast majority of digestion takes place.
(There's a reason you've probably seen corn kernels or sesame seeds in your poop, but never intact meat fibers!) Why does this matter? Because your colon is where the highest concentration of bacteria resides, and it's the segment of the digestive tract where your "leftover" food spends the most time: anywhere from 10 to 64 hours in normal, healthy adults on average.
They also contend that when meats are eaten with grains or starches, it results in the meat "putrefying" in the gut because various digestive factors required to process protein and carbohydrate – be they enzymes or pH levels – "neutralize" one another and prevent the digestion of both.
Another argument made by food combining enthusiasts is that starch digestion supposedly reduces stomach acidity, which is an essential pre-requisite for a protein-digesting enzyme (or protease) called pepsin to work effectively.
And while it's true that pepsin requires an acidic environment to be activated from its precursor form, starches do not neutralize the stomach's acidic pH more or less than any other food.

Don't combine different types of protein: Our body has different kinds of mechanism to digest different food items and if we eat proteins of different combinations, only one of them will be efficiently digested by our body.
Revealed; how wrong food combinations can lead to indigestion and gas Pair the right foods together to help better your digestion.
Nutritionist Elizabeth Montgomery gives an overview on why certain food combinations hinder digestion and which food combinations one should opt for.
Animal protein and non-starchy vegetables make for easy digestion which will enhance one&#8217;s ability to breakdown the nutrients and eliminate efficiently.
Another point is that the body secretes a particular kind of enzyme at a given time so spreading out your protein intake over the day will result in better digestion.
